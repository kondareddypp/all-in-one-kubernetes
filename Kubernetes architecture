Kubernetes architecture is designed to provide scalability, reliability, and automation for managing containerized applications. Here's an overview of its key components:

---

## **1. Master Node (Control Plane)**
The master node is responsible for managing the cluster and ensuring the desired state of applications.

### Components:
- **API Server**: Acts as the front end for the Kubernetes control plane, exposing APIs for interaction.
- **Scheduler**: Assigns workloads (pods) to appropriate worker nodes based on resource availability.
- **Controller Manager**: Ensures the desired state of the cluster by managing controllers like ReplicationController, NodeController, etc.
- **etcd**: A key-value store used to store cluster configuration and state.

---

## **2. Worker Nodes**
Worker nodes run the containerized applications and handle workloads assigned by the master node.

### Components:
- **Kubelet**: An agent that ensures containers are running in a Pod.
- **Kube-Proxy**: Manages networking and communication between pods and services.
- **Container Runtime**: Executes containers (e.g., Docker, containerd).

---

## **3. Key Objects in Kubernetes**
These objects help define and manage your applications and workloads.

### Key Objects:
- **Pod**: The smallest deployable unit in Kubernetes, representing one or more containers.
- **Service**: Exposes a set of pods as a network service.
- **Deployment**: Manages the deployment and scaling of pods.
- **ConfigMap** and **Secret**: Store configuration data and sensitive information, respectively.

---

## **4. Cluster Networking**
Kubernetes networking ensures seamless communication between pods, services, and external users.

### Features:
- **Pod-to-Pod Communication**: Pods within the cluster communicate without Network Address Translation (NAT).
- **Service Discovery**: Automatically assigns DNS names to services.
- **Ingress**: Manages external HTTP/S traffic to applications.

---

## **5. Add-Ons**
Optional components to extend Kubernetes functionality:
- **Dashboard**: A web-based UI for managing the cluster.
- **Monitoring**: Tools like Prometheus and Grafana for performance monitoring.
- **Logging**: Centralized logging systems like Fluentd.
